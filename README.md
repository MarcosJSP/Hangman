# Hangman

This project was made for [EOI-Garantía Juvenil: Programa de Especialización en Programación FullStack (2019)](https://www.spegc.org/formacion-y-eventos/programacion-fullstack-4/) teaming up with [@NassrEML](https://github.com/NassrEML). I was in charge of the design and css, and also did some js.

The result is the classical Hangman game, in this case the player has to find out the name of a popular film before the time runs out (60s). If the player chooses 5 wrong letters the game will end in defeat.
